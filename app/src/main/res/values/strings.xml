    <string name="next_step">Autism spectrum disorder is a spectrum of disorders
with a shared core of symptoms including difficulties
with social interaction, empathy, communication, and flexible behavior. While autism is usually diagnosed at a young age, some adults with high-functioning autism do go undiagnosed until adulthood. If you’re interested in being evaluated for ASD, begin with your family doctor, who will evaluate you and likely refer you to a psychiatrist or psychologist for indept assessment. Adult ASD can be treated with different types of psychotherapy depending on the challenges you’re experiencing.</string>
